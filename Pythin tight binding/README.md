Python notebooks - Tingth binding (TB) simulatins for easier problems to better understand what we're doing.

BiTeI_K.py - my code for BiTeI TB, should eventually be working correctly

wanr2k.py - Saeed's python version of the code (modified by me a tiny bit to match plotting routines) may contain a mistake in phase calculation, I'll check it up with Saeed.
